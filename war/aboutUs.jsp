	 <blockquote>	
	    Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend searching frantically for a blood donor, 
		when blood banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time keeps ticking? 
		<br>
		<br>
		Have you witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour?
		Is it something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This thought laid our foundation.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>"FULL BloodBank"</b> is an organization that brings voluntary blood donors and those in need of blood on to a common platform.  
	Through this website, we seek donors who are willing to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest support to those in frantic need of it. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Started in the year 2015, on 05th Nov, in a small room with just 100 voluntary donors but with the zeal to serve our society, 
	to inspire and spread the word, we dream to fulfill 100% blood need in India.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Mission: <strong>"Our mission is to fulfill every blood request in the country with a promising web portal and motivated individuals who are willing to donate blood."</strong>
